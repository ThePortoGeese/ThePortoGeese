## "Now I have become the exception, destroyer of programs" - Githeimer

Am I writing this instead of programming? Yes. Am I procrastinating? For sure! But you know what? History's biggest persons procastinated too. 

Abraham Lincoln once famously said: "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four lying on the sofa." Or something like that. I might have missed that history class about American History. 

Even the great Fernando Pessoa wrote:
"Hoje estou triste, estou triste.
Estarei alegre amanh√£...
O que se sente consiste
Sempre em qualquer coisa v√£."

## Who am I? Or What am I?

I'm just a chill guy who likes programming.

I might spend too much time gaming but, hey, it's for SUPER EARTH and DEMOCRACY. How can I not?

I also too love History and doing other stuff!

## What about actual work?

Currently learning Dart, flutter and Unity while doing mobile apps for ISPGAYA. 

I did some applications in C++ and C# for my school. Please do not judge me for those :P

Besides everything, I do love programming. It's my passion. My craft. I might procrastinate but, those moments where I do actual work? They are the greatest moments ever.

## Ok, going back to work now, have fun exploring!
