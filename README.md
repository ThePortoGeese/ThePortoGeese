## "Now I have become the exception, destroyer of programs" - Githeimer

Am I writing this instead of programming? Yes. Am I procrastinating? For sure! But you know what? History's biggest persons procastinated too. 

Abraham Lincoln once famously said: "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four lying on the sofa." Or something like that. I might have missed that history class about American History. 

Even the great Fernando Pessoa wrote:
"Hoje estou triste, estou triste.
Estarei alegre amanhã...
O que se sente consiste
Sempre em qualquer coisa vã."

## Who am I? Or What am I?

I'm just a chill guy who likes programming.

I might spend too much time gaming but, hey, it's for SUPER EARTH and DEMOCRACY. How can I not?

History and the arts are interesting subjects that I like to explore in my own projects so do not be surprised if you see some cool sprites or cool history references around here!

## What about actual work?

I WAS PART OF THE DEV TEAM OF RETROLVER, THE GREATEST GAME IN EXISTANCE: https://theportogeese.itch.io/retrolver

Currently working on my 2 games and a small messaging app. If you see a series of private commits that's probably what I was working on. 

I used Dart and flutter to create mobile apps for ISPGAYA. 
I did some applications in C++ and C# for my school. Please do not judge me for those :P


Besides everything, I do love programming. It's my passion. My craft. I might procrastinate but, those moments where I do actual work? They are the greatest moments ever.

## GAMEJAMS!!
OMFG I love gamejams!!!!!! Im part of CYBER PANELAS, a team of my 4 awesome friends!
